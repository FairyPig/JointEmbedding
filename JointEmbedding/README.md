# Joint Embeddings of Shapes and Images via CNN Image Purification
Created by Yangyan Li, Hao Su, Charles Ruizhongtai Qi, Leonidas J. Guibas from Stanford University, and Noa Fish, Daniel Cohen-Or from Tel Aviv University.

### Introduction
We propose a way to embed 3D shapes and 2D images into a joint embedding space, thus all of the 3D shapes and 2D images become searchable from each other (<a href="https://shapenet.cs.stanford.edu/shapenet_brain/app_joint_embedding/" target="_blank">live demo</a>). The <a href="http://geometry.stanford.edu/projects/jointembedding/" target="_blank">research paper</a> was onditionally accepted to SIGGRAPH Asia 2015.
