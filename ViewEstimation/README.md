# Render for CNN: Viewpoint Estimation in Images Using CNNs Trained with Rendered 3D Model Views
Created by Hao Su, Charles Ruizhongtai Qi, Yangyan Li and Leonidas J. Guibas from Stanford University.

### Introduction
We propose a way to generate large amount of overfit-resistant **synthetic** images, for training a CNN that is capable of predicting the camera viewpoint of **real** images. The research paper was accepted to ICCV 2015 (oral).
